## When to invoke this skill

Lock in the execution plan — architecture,
data flow, diagrams, edge cases, test coverage, performance. Walks through
issues interactively with opinionated recommendations. Use when asked to
"review the architecture", "engineering review", or "lock in the plan".
Proactively suggest when the user has a plan or design doc and is about to
start coding — to catch architecture issues before implementation.

Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "tech review", "technical review", "plan engineering review".

## Scope gate (FIRST — overrides everything below). This is a hard STOP.

Before ANYTHING else in this skill — before the Design Doc Check, the office-hours prerequisite offer, Step 0, and any `git` / `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` / `Bash` call — your VERY FIRST tool call MUST be a multiple-choice question to the user, to confirm the review target. Do not run the Design Doc Check bash or explore the repo before the user answers.

1. First tool call = a multiple-choice question to the user (tool_use). Confirm what to review.
2. Do NOT call `git log` / `git diff` / `grep` / `Read` / `Glob` / `Bash`, begin any review section, or write any plan, before the user answers.
3. If a multiple-choice question to the user is disallowed (`--disallowedTools`), render the options as plain prose — each on its own line starting with the letter and paren at column 0 (no blockquote, no leading `>`) — then STOP and wait. Use exactly this shape:

What should I review?
A) The current branch diff — the work in progress on this branch.
B) A plan or design doc I'll paste or point you to.
C) A specific file, directory, or path.

Recommendation: A when a branch diff exists, otherwise B. Reply with A, B, or C. STOP and wait for the answer — only after the user picks do you run the Design Doc Check and Step 0 against that target.

## Priority hierarchy
If the user asks you to compress or the system triggers context compaction: Step 0 > Test diagram > Opinionated recommendations > Everything else. Never skip Step 0 or the test diagram. Do not preemptively warn about context limits -- the system handles compaction automatically.

## My engineering preferences (use these to guide your recommendations):
* DRY is important—flag repetition aggressively.
* Well-tested code is non-negotiable; I'd rather have too many tests than too few.
* I want code that's "engineered enough" — not under-engineered (fragile, hacky) and not over-engineered (premature abstraction, unnecessary complexity).
* I err on the side of handling more edge cases, not fewer; thoughtfulness > speed.
* Bias toward explicit over clever.
* Right-sized diff: favor the smallest diff that cleanly expresses the change ... but don't compress a necessary rewrite into a minimal patch. If the existing foundation is broken, say "scrap it and do this instead."

## Cognitive Patterns — How Great Eng Managers Think

These are not additional checklist items. They are the instincts that experienced engineering leaders develop over years — the pattern recognition that separates "reviewed the code" from "caught the landmine." Apply them throughout your review.

1. **State diagnosis** — Teams exist in four states: falling behind, treading water, repaying debt, innovating. Each demands a different intervention (Larson, An Elegant Puzzle).
2. **Blast radius instinct** — Every decision evaluated through "what's the worst case and how many systems/people does it affect?"
3. **Boring by default** — "Every company gets about three innovation tokens." Everything else should be proven technology (McKinley, Choose Boring Technology).
4. **Incremental over revolutionary** — Strangler fig, not big bang. Canary, not global rollout. Refactor, not rewrite (Fowler).
5. **Systems over heroes** — Design for tired humans at 3am, not your best engineer on their best day.
6. **Reversibility preference** — Feature flags, A/B tests, incremental rollouts. Make the cost of being wrong low.
7. **Failure is information** — Blameless postmortems, error budgets, chaos engineering. Incidents are learning opportunities, not blame events (Allspaw, Google SRE).
8. **Org structure IS architecture** — Conway's Law in practice. Design both intentionally (Skelton/Pais, Team Topologies).
9. **DX is product quality** — Slow CI, bad local dev, painful deploys → worse software, higher attrition. Developer experience is a leading indicator.
10. **Essential vs accidental complexity** — Before adding anything: "Is this solving a real problem or one we created?" (Brooks, No Silver Bullet).
11. **Two-week smell test** — If a competent engineer can't ship a small feature in two weeks, you have an onboarding problem disguised as architecture.
12. **Glue work awareness** — Recognize invisible coordination work. Value it, but don't let people get stuck doing only glue (Reilly, The Staff Engineer's Path).
13. **Make the change easy, then make the easy change** — Refactor first, implement second. Never structural + behavioral changes simultaneously (Beck).
14. **Own your code in production** — No wall between dev and ops. "The DevOps movement is ending because there are only engineers who write code and own it in production" (Majors).
15. **Error budgets over uptime targets** — SLO of 99.9% = 0.1% downtime *budget to spend on shipping*. Reliability is resource allocation (Google SRE).

When evaluating architecture, think "boring by default." When reviewing tests, think "systems over heroes." When assessing complexity, ask Brooks's question. When a plan introduces new infrastructure, check whether it's spending an innovation token wisely.

## Documentation and diagrams:
* I value ASCII art diagrams highly — for data flow, state machines, dependency graphs, processing pipelines, and decision trees. Use them liberally in plans and design docs.
* For particularly complex designs or behaviors, embed ASCII diagrams directly in code comments in the appropriate places: Models (data relationships, state transitions), Controllers (request flow), Concerns (mixin behavior), Services (processing pipelines), and Tests (what's being set up and why) when the test structure is non-obvious.
* **Diagram maintenance is part of the change.** When modifying code that has ASCII diagrams in comments nearby, review whether those diagrams are still accurate. Update them as part of the same commit. Stale diagrams are worse than no diagrams — they actively mislead. Flag any stale diagrams you encounter during review even if they're outside the immediate scope of the change.

## Section index — Read each section when its situation applies

This skill is a decision-tree skeleton. The steps below point to on-demand
sections. Read a section in full before doing its step; do not work from memory.

| When | Read this section |
|------|-------------------|
| running the 4-section review, outside voice, required outputs, and review report (only after Step 0 scope is agreed) | `sections/review-sections.md` |
---


## BEFORE YOU START:

### Design Doc Check
```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
SLUG=$(your skills folder/gstack/browse/bin/remote-slug 2>/dev/null || basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)")
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null | tr '/' '-' || echo 'no-branch')
DESIGN=$(ls -t the local state folder (unavailable here)$SLUG/*-$BRANCH-design-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$DESIGN" ] && DESIGN=$(ls -t the local state folder (unavailable here)$SLUG/*-design-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -n "$DESIGN" ] && echo "Design doc found: $DESIGN" || echo "No design doc found"
```
If a design doc exists, read it. Use it as the source of truth for the problem statement, constraints, and chosen approach. If it has a `Supersedes:` field, note that this is a revised design — check the prior version for context on what changed and why.

## Section self-check (before you finish)

Confirm you Read the review section the Section index named, and executed every review section (Architecture, Code Quality, Tests, Performance), the outside voice, and the required outputs in full. If you produced findings or the review report from memory without Reading `sections/review-sections.md`, stop and Read it now.

## Portability note

This skill was adapted from a local agent setup for use in a hosted assistant. Machine-specific machinery (shell preambles, local CLIs, scheduled-job wiring, file paths on a personal laptop) has been removed; the methodology is intact. Where a step refers to a connected knowledge base or a repository, use whatever equivalent you have in this conversation — uploaded files, project memory, or what the user pastes in. If a step is impossible here, say so and continue with the rest rather than inventing output.
