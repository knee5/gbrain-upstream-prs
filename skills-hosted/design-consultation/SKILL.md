## When to invoke this skill

Creates DESIGN.md as your project's design source
of truth. For existing sites, use /plan-design-review to infer the system instead.
Use when asked to "design system", "brand guidelines", or "create DESIGN.md".
Proactively suggest when starting a new project's UI with no existing
design system or DESIGN.md.

## Phase 0: Pre-checks

**Check for existing DESIGN.md:**

```bash
ls DESIGN.md design-system.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_DESIGN_FILE"
```

- If a DESIGN.md exists: Read it. Ask the user: "You already have a design system. Want to **update** it, **start fresh**, or **cancel**?"
- If no DESIGN.md: continue.

**Gather product context from the codebase:**

```bash
cat README.md 2>/dev/null | head -50
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | head -20
ls src/ app/ pages/ components/ 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

Look for office-hours output:

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
eval "$(the local helper CLI (unavailable here) 2>/dev/null)"
ls the local state folder (unavailable here)$SLUG/*office-hours* 2>/dev/null | head -5
ls .context/*office-hours* .context/attachments/*office-hours* 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

If office-hours output exists, read it — the product context is pre-filled.

If the codebase is empty and purpose is unclear, say: *"I don't have a clear picture of what you're building yet. Want to explore first with `/office-hours`? Once we know the product direction, we can set up the design system."*

**Find the browse binary (optional — enables visual competitive research):**

## Section index — Read each section when its situation applies

This skill is a decision-tree skeleton. The steps below point to on-demand
sections. Read a section in full before doing its step; do not work from memory.

| When | Read this section |
|------|-------------------|
| building the complete design-system proposal, drill-downs, the design preview, and writing DESIGN.md (Phases 3-6, after product context and research) | `sections/proposal-and-preview.md` |

---

## Phase 1: Product Context

Ask the user a single question that covers everything you need to know. Pre-fill what you can infer from the codebase.

**a multiple-choice question to the user Q1 — include ALL of these:**
1. Confirm what the product is, who it's for, what space/industry
2. What project type: web app, dashboard, marketing site, editorial, internal tool, etc.
3. "Want me to research what top products in your space are doing for design, or should I work from my design knowledge?"
4. **Explicitly say:** "At any point you can just drop into chat and we'll talk through anything — this isn't a rigid form, it's a conversation."

If the README or office-hours output gives you enough context, pre-fill and confirm: *"From what I can see, this is [X] for [Y] in the [Z] space. Sound right? And would you like me to research what's out there in this space, or should I work from what I know?"*

**Memorable-thing forcing question.** Before moving on, ask the user: *"What's the one
thing you want someone to remember after they see this product for the first time?"*

One sentence answer. Could be a feeling ("this is serious software for serious work"),
a visual ("the blue that's almost black"), a claim ("faster than anything else"), or
a posture ("for builders, not managers"). Write it down. Every subsequent design
decision should serve this memorable thing. Design that tries to be memorable for
everything is memorable for nothing.

### Taste profile (if this user has prior sessions)

Read the persistent taste profile if it exists:

```bash
_TASTE_PROFILE=the local state folder (unavailable here)$SLUG/taste-profile.json
if [ -f "$_TASTE_PROFILE" ]; then
  # Schema v1: { dimensions: { fonts, colors, layouts, aesthetics }, sessions: [] }
  # Each dimension has approved[] and rejected[] entries with
  # { value, confidence, approved_count, rejected_count, last_seen }
  # Confidence decays 5% per week of inactivity — computed at read time.
  cat "$_TASTE_PROFILE" 2>/dev/null | head -200
  echo "TASTE_PROFILE_FOUND"
else
  echo "NO_TASTE_PROFILE"
fi
```

**If TASTE_PROFILE_FOUND:** Summarize the strongest signals (top 3 approved entries
per dimension by confidence * approved_count). Include them in the design brief:

"Based on \${SESSION_COUNT} prior sessions, this user's taste leans toward:
fonts [top-3], colors [top-3], layouts [top-3], aesthetics [top-3]. Bias
generation toward these unless the user explicitly requests a different direction.
Also avoid their strong rejections: [top-3 rejected per dimension]."

**If NO_TASTE_PROFILE:** Fall through to per-session approved.json files (legacy).

**Conflict handling:** If the current user request contradicts a strong persistent
signal (e.g., "make it playful" when taste profile strongly prefers minimal), flag
it: "Note: your taste profile strongly prefers minimal. You're asking for playful
this time — I'll proceed, but want me to update the taste profile, or treat this
as a one-off?"

**Decay:** Confidence scores decay 5% per week. A font approved 6 months ago with
10 approvals has less weight than one approved last week. The decay calculation
happens at read time, not write time, so the file only grows on change.

**Schema migration:** If the file has no `version` field or `version: 0`, it's
the legacy approved.json aggregate — `the local helper CLI (unavailable here)`
will migrate it to schema v1 on the next write.

If a taste profile exists for this project, factor it into your Phase 3 proposal.
The profile reflects what the user has actually approved in prior sessions — treat
it as a demonstrated preference, not a constraint. You may still deliberately
depart from it if the product direction demands something different; when you do,
say so explicitly and connect the departure to the memorable-thing answer above.

## Phase 2: Research (only if user said yes)

If the user wants competitive research:

**Step 1: Identify what's out there via WebSearch**

Use WebSearch to find 5-10 products in their space. Search for:
- "[product category] website design"
- "[product category] best websites 2025"
- "best [industry] web apps"

**Step 2: Visual research via browse (if available)**

If the browse binary is available (`$B` is set), visit the top 3-5 sites in the space and capture visual evidence:

```bash
$B goto "https://example-site.com"
$B screenshot "/tmp/design-research-site-name.png"
$B snapshot
```

For each site, analyze: fonts actually used, color palette, layout approach, spacing density, aesthetic direction. The screenshot gives you the feel; the snapshot gives you structural data.

If a site blocks the headless browser or requires login, skip it and note why.

If browse is not available, rely on WebSearch results and your built-in design knowledge — this is fine.

**Step 3: Synthesize findings**

**Three-layer synthesis:**
- **Layer 1 (tried and true):** What design patterns does every product in this category share? These are table stakes — users expect them.
- **Layer 2 (new and popular):** What are the search results and current design discourse saying? What's trending? What new patterns are emerging?
- **Layer 3 (first principles):** Given what we know about THIS product's users and positioning — is there a reason the conventional design approach is wrong? Where should we deliberately break from the category norms?

**Eureka check:** If Layer 3 reasoning reveals a genuine design insight — a reason the category's visual language fails THIS product — name it: "EUREKA: Every [category] product does X because they assume [assumption]. But this product's users [evidence] — so we should do Y instead." Log the eureka moment (see preamble).

Summarize conversationally:
> "I looked at what's out there. Here's the landscape: they converge on [patterns]. Most of them feel [observation — e.g., interchangeable, polished but generic, etc.]. The opportunity to stand out is [gap]. Here's where I'd play it safe and where I'd take a risk..."

**Graceful degradation:**
- Browse available → screenshots + snapshots + WebSearch (richest research)
- Browse unavailable → WebSearch only (still good)
- WebSearch also unavailable → agent's built-in design knowledge (always works)

If the user said no research, skip entirely and proceed to Phase 3 using your built-in design knowledge.

## Important Rules

1. **Propose, don't present menus.** You are a consultant, not a form. Make opinionated recommendations based on the product context, then let the user adjust.
2. **Every recommendation needs a rationale.** Never say "I recommend X" without "because Y."
3. **Coherence over individual choices.** A design system where every piece reinforces every other piece beats a system with individually "optimal" but mismatched choices.
4. **Never recommend blacklisted or overused fonts as primary.** If the user specifically requests one, comply but explain the tradeoff.
5. **The preview page must be beautiful.** It's the first visual output and sets the tone for the whole skill.
6. **Conversational tone.** This isn't a rigid workflow. If the user wants to talk through a decision, engage as a thoughtful design partner.
7. **Accept the user's final choice.** Nudge on coherence issues, but never block or refuse to write a DESIGN.md because you disagree with a choice.
8. **No AI slop in your own output.** Your recommendations, your preview page, your DESIGN.md — all should demonstrate the taste you're asking the user to adopt.

## Portability note

This skill was adapted from a local agent setup for use in a hosted assistant. Machine-specific machinery (shell preambles, local CLIs, scheduled-job wiring, file paths on a personal laptop) has been removed; the methodology is intact. Where a step refers to a connected knowledge base or a repository, use whatever equivalent you have in this conversation — uploaded files, project memory, or what the user pastes in. If a step is impossible here, say so and continue with the rest rather than inventing output.
